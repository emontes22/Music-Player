# Music-Player

Music player to learn the basics of Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## Description
---
The project takes a folder with music and cover albums to display while the website is running. The user is able to play/pause music, change song (forward or backward) and skip to a specific minute while the music is playing.

The objective of this project was to be able to understand how Javascript works with HTML and CSS to create a website that the user can interact with and also make the website available to be responsive in all devices and screen types.
Document Object Model (DOM) was a big and essential part of this project and different selectors were implemented to create a great user experience while using the website and all its features.
